# burger

This is a burger logger using  MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!) that follows the MVC design pattern.

You can add new burgers to the list, select one and click the "Devour" button and keep a running tab on which burgers have you eaten already!

Demo showing reading from database, adding a new burger to database and changing status to "devoured"
